##README_Xue,Xiaosu

This directory contains my solutions to problem sets from an online course: Data Wrangling with MongoDB at Udacity.com-- https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032

The /data directory contains the datafile to be processed
The /src directory contains the source code written in Python for parsing the data
The files are placed under the two directories for better organization. The datafile and the source code should be under the same directory for the program to run properly. The datafiles for parse_html, parse_json, xml_split, and xml are missing. They exist solely on Udacity.com.
